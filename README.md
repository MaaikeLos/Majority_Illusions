# Majority_Illusions
Code for simulations (and analysis of their data) on the likelihood of majority illusions in graphs.
This code belongs to the paper 'On the Graph Theory of Majority Illusions: Theoretical Results and Computational Experiments' by Maaike Venema-Los, Zoé Christoff, and Davide Grossi.

The Python code to run the simulations is in the Jupyter file 'main_experiments.ipynb' in the folder 'Python_code'.
The R code to run the data analysis for Erdös-Rényi graphs, Holme-Kim graphs, and a Facebook network is in the folders ER_analysis, HK_analysis, and FB_analysis, respectively.
